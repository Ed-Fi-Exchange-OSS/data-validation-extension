# data-validation-extension

This project consists of the code that will allow for the implementaiton of the Level 2 data validation API as an EdFi extension.

Users will need to have MetaEd installed and configured in their environment. They can then download the MetaEd folder and build and deploy it locally, as if they had authored the extension.

For more information see the EdFi documentation that has examples on how to do an extension.

There is also a SQL file that has a seed scripts that will put the descriptors in and another that will create the resource claims that are needed.
